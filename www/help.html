				<h2>Card Entry</h2>
				<p>Cards images are gathered from <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a>, so all card names should match their format.</p>
				<p>Some clean up is done on card names, so if you enter a two sided card like <strong>"Breaking//Entering"</strong> it will be automatically converted to the correct but counter-intuitive <strong>"Breaking (Breaking/Entering)."</strong> Or, if you enter <strong>"AEtherize"</strong> instead of <strong>"Ætherize,"</strong> we'll automatically convert that wierd unicode character for you.</p>
				<p>We don't catch everything though, so if you have trouble entering a card name search for it on <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a> to find the appropriate spelling.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="stage" id="chooseSet">
				<h2>Choosing Sets</h2>
				<p>Cards can have sets specified by adding a set tag to the end of the card name enclosed in square brackets, [ and ], such as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Island [guru]</li>
					<li>Forest [zen]</li>
					<li>Swamp [uh]</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The list of set codes can be found at <a href="http://www.magiccards.info/sitemap.html" target="_blank">magiccards.info/sitemap.html</a>, right next to the set names.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<h3>Cool Lands</h3>
				<p>When you leave any basic lands with unspecified sets, the "Coolify Basics" feature will distribute them randomly between the four coolest arts, Zendikar, Guru, Unhinged, and Alpha.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="stage" id="choosePrinting">
				<h2>Choosing Printings</h2>
				<p>Cards can have multiple printings within the same set, if you have selected a set for your card you can also select a printing by adding the printing number in angle brackets, &lt; and &gt;, such as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Island [zen]&lt;234&gt;</li>
					<li>Island [zen]&lt;235&gt;</li>
					<li>Island [zen]&lt;236&gt;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To find the different printing numbers for the card you are examining, search for the card in your specific set on <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a> and look at the column in the top right of the page labeled "Printings". The numbers found here are the printing numbers that can selected.</p>
				<p>Alternatively you can go to <a href="http://www.magiccards.info/sitemap.html" target="_blank">magiccards.info/sitemap.html</a> and select your set to see a full list of all printings in that set.</p>
				<p><strong>Note that this feature requires a set to be specified, and when looking up printings on <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a> remember to use advanced search to specify your set.</strong></p>
				<h3>Full Art Lands</h3>
				<p>When you leave any basic lands with unspecified sets, the "Full Art Basics" feature will distribute them randomly amongst the various printings with full artwork.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="stage" id="tokens">
				<h2>Tokens</h2>
				<p>Tokens do not need to be entered manually, tokens are automatically included when you download your deck, and will appear along side it as a seperate pile of cards.</p>
				<p>Our database is only missing a few tokens, like ones from early sets that have no official art. For the most part you can rely on the automatic token generation to provide exactly what you need.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<h3>Token Sources</h3>
				<p>The token names and token producing card information was taken from the <a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Token/Full_List">mtgsalvation wiki</a>, and the images were gathered manually from google as there is no reliable public source for them.</p>
				<p>If you want the resources for development or any other reason, here are our processed computer-readable versions</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/misc/tokenproducers.csv">Token names and producers</a></li>
					<li><a href="/misc/tokenimages.tar">Token images</a></li>
				</ul>

			<div class="stage" id="drafting">
				<h2>Drafting</h2>
				<p>The drafting tool can be used to generate randomized packs using minimal resources, an average of 9MB per set independent of the number of packs. This is possible because most sets will fit inside of four deck images which can be reused for every pack.</p>
				<p>Set images are only ever generated once, which means the automatic caching in TTS gives you instant loading, and that generating new packs on this site is fast, usually under a quarter of a second.</p>
				<p>Once generated and downloaded, your packs will never change. This means <strong>you must remake your draft packs for every new draft.</strong></p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="stage" id="compression">
				<h2>Deck Compression</h2>
				<p>Deck images are put through a high JPEG compression compared to normal images, this is a because deck images are around 10 mega pixels with some decks requiring multiple images. In order to shorten download times in game, images are ran through either 50% or 80% compression, depending on your chosen settings. Below are examples of these images and their resulting sizes.</p>
				<p>Tabletop simulator does similar compression after downloading the files, depending on your video settings the level 0 compression and level 50 compression will be identical. If you are don't find this to be the case and want a very high quality that option has been provided.</p>

				<h2>Choosing Languages(Experimental)</h2>
				<p>Similar to how <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a> offers search features for different sets, it offers search features for different languages. The card images that it offers though are of low quality, typically mislabeled and actually in english. If you are able to find your card you can add it to your deck as in the examples below, but don't expect to work for all cards. Cards in foreign languages must be entered with their foreign spelling, which can be found on <a href="http://www.magiccards.info" target="_blank">magiccards.info</a>.</p>
				<p>Languages are entered with language tags at the end of the card name enclosed in curly brackets, { and }, such as</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Anafenza, Geist des Sippenbaums {de}</li>
					<li>伊莫库之手 {cn}</li>
					<li>원소 돌파 {ko}</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The list of language codes can be found at <a href="http://www.magiccards.info/sitemap.html" target="_blank">magiccards.info/sitemap.html</a>, right next to the language headers.</p>
